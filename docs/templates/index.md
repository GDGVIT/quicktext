## Why QuickText?

Text classification is a simple task. However writing code for a text classifier is not that simple, it takes a lot of time and effort

QuickText aims to save that time and effort by providing 

- Utilities to process the training dataset
- Utilities to vectorize input text using pre-trained word vectors
- Text classification models 
- Trainer to train the models

## Why sPacy

sPacy is an extremely fast and scalable NLP library.
sPacy is a core part of this framework. 
Their rich API allows us to create components for tokenizing text or getting word embeddings that speeds up the process of training. 

Moreover sPacy has support for 59+ languages, hence this multiple language support can also be utilized in QuickText

## Goals

These are our goals for the alpha release

- Provide support for multiple sPacy models
- Provide several sequence classification models
- Provide onnx support for classification models
- Add support for other pre-trained word-vectors
