# QuickText

!!! danger "Important"
    This project is still in its early stage of development. We have great things planned. Stay Tuned

Hey there, welcome to QuickText

> QuickText is a text classification framework built using sPacy and PyTorch

> This project is still under development, docs will be updated soon

> All contributions are welcome

> If you want to contribute, open an issue on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/GDGVIT/quicktext)



## Why QuickText?

Text classification is a simple task. However writing code for a text classifier is not that simple, it takes a lot of time and effort

QuickText aims to save that time and effort by providing 

- Simple API to use a text classifier
- A versatile trainer to train the classifier
- Several model architectures
- Close integration with sPacy, use our classifiers in sPacy pipeline
- Use your own custom PyTorch models with our classifier API
